= License

I'm not a lawyer, so licensing is an issue for me.
Licensing a mixed project like this, containing both source and content, is twice as hard.

I decided to go with link:.license/MIT.adoc[the MIT License] for the source code in this repo.
This includes all the files in link:schema[`schema`] and link:.github[`.github`] directories as well as the source code in the root of the repository.

The actual content of this repository — the recipes in the link:recipes[`recipes`] directory — is licensed under link:++.license/CC BY-SA 4.0.txt++[the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International] (CC BY-SA 4.0).
